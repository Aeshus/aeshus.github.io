Heya!

I'm trying to make a cool little website here!

Some notes:

1. Had to write that git commit hash thing
2. Noticed that the [metas documentation on lume](https://lume.land/plugins/metas/) uses `<header>` instead of `<head>`.  
  a. [fix: metas plugin typos by Aeshus · Pull Request #90 · lumeland/lume.land](https://github.com/lumeland/lume.land/pull/90)  
  b. got a shiki syntax-highlighting plugin on  
  c. noticed plugin docs issues  
3. Still need to setup MDX and find out if JSX is prerendered...
4. Upgrade to Lume v2 coming out soon?

## Testing for shiki

```ts
const a = () => {
  console.log("hi");
};
```

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hi nerds!");
}
```

```txt
Hi
```

```
Wow
```
